# RFP-001 — Admin Authority Library

## 🧭 Overview

Build a reusable library that provides standardised access control for LEE
programs, where privileged functions, including the ability to transfer or
renounce authority, can only be called by an admin authority.

The library must be integrated into the SPEL framework and ship with
documentation and usage examples so teams can enable the pattern with minimal
boilerplate.

## 🔥 Why This Matters

As the Logos ecosystem grows, programs deployed on LEZ need foundational
security primitives from day one. Without standardised access control, every
team must design their own — leading to inconsistent implementations, duplicated
effort, and a higher risk of critical vulnerabilities.

Delivering this as a shared library lowers the barrier for developers building
on LEE. Teams can focus on application logic rather than re-inventing admin
authority patterns, accelerating the pace at which new programs ship.

## ✅ Scope of Work

### Hard Requirements

#### Functionality

1. Admin authority is set at program initialisation.
2. Admin authority can transfer admin authority to a new signer.
3. Admin authority can revoke admin authority, effectively renouncing admin
   control.
4. Admin authority is the only one that can call privileged instructions exposed
   by the library (demonstrated via a gated `config` PDA update).

#### Usability

1. The library is integrated into the
   [SPEL framework](https://github.com/logos-co/spel) so that programs using
   SPEL can enable admin authority with minimal boilerplate — ideally a single
   annotation or configuration flag.
2. There can only be one admin authority (signer) at a time.
3. Documentation includes at least one end-to-end usage example showing how a
   SPEL program gates its own instructions behind the admin authority.

#### Performance

No compute budget constraints are expected for this library. Document the
additional transaction size overhead introduced by the admin authority check on
any gated instruction.

#### Supportability

1. CI must be green on the default branch.
2. Every hard requirement in Functionality, Usability, and Reliability has at
   least one corresponding test.
3. A README documents how to add the library as a dependency and integrate it
   into a SPEL program, including a step-by-step example.
4. A sample program that imports the library is included to validate the
   integration path and serve as a reference for consumers.

### Soft Requirements

If possible.

#### Reliability

1. Admin authority can only be set to a valid new signer (on-curve key or
   deployed PDA), when set or initialised.

## 👤 Recommended Team Profile

Developer experienced with:

- Solana or SVM program development (Anchor or native)
- Access control and authority patterns in on-chain programs
- PDA derivation and account validation
- Writing and running on-chain tests (e.g. Bankrun, Anchor tests)
- Library/crate packaging and documentation

## ⏱ Timeline Expectations

Estimated duration: **4 weeks**

## 🌍 Open Source Requirement

All code must be released under the **MIT+Apache2.0 License**.
