# Appendix: Token Vesting Ecosystem

This appendix surveys existing token vesting protocols and related
infrastructure across the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. It serves as a
reference for [RFP-017](../RFPs/RFP-017-token-vesting.md), providing context on
current market participants, their mechanisms, fee structures, and design
trade-offs.

## Protocols Surveyed

Protocols are ordered by adoption scale (largest first) and this order is
maintained throughout the document.

| Protocol          | Ecosystem                | Type                     | Fee                               | TVL / Locked Value   | Launched |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| Magna             | EVM + Solana + Aptos     | Enterprise vesting       | Undisclosed (enterprise)          | $60B peak (2025) [1] | 2021     |
| Sablier           | EVM (27 chains) + Solana | Streaming / vesting      | Zero (optional broker 0--10%) [2] | ~$500K on-chain [3]  | 2019     |
| Streamflow        | Solana (primary)         | Vesting / distribution   | 0.16 SOL per contract [4]         | N/A                  | 2021     |
| Hedgey Finance    | EVM + Solana             | Vesting / lockups        | Zero [5]                          | N/A                  | 2022     |

| AbdelStark ERC-20 | EVM                      | Reference library        | Zero (self-deployed) [11]         | N/A                  | 2021     |
| Tokenomist        | Data / analytics         | Aggregator               | Free (basic tier) [12]            | N/A (data only)      | 2022     |

## Scale and Traction

Token vesting is a mature, high-value infrastructure category. Tokenomist
documented $97.43B in token vesting unlocks across major crypto projects during
2025 alone [12], spanning infrastructure and L1 tokens, DeFi, AI, and L2
sectors.

The on-chain vesting protocol market has consolidated around a small number of
dominant protocols. EVM and Solana are effectively saturated for standard
vesting functionality; competition has driven fees to zero for most protocols.
The frontier is privacy, novel VMs, and cross-chain composability.

**Magna** is the largest vesting platform by TVL, reaching $60B at peak in 2025
[1]. Magna serves 160+ enterprise clients with both on-chain escrow contracts
and off-chain schedule management (tokens remain in treasury, distributed at
unlock time). The platform supports EVM, Solana, and Aptos, making it the
broadest multi-VM vesting solution. In February 2026, Magna was acquired by
Payward (Kraken's parent company) [13], validating the strategic value of
vesting infrastructure at institutional scale.

**Sablier** is the longest-running vesting protocol (since 2019), deployed
across 27 EVM chains and Solana [2]. It offers four product packages (Lockup,
Flow, Airdrops, Bob) and is the only protocol with custom vesting curves
(LockupDynamic). All stream positions are ERC-721 NFTs, enabling secondary
market trading and DeFi composability. Backed by a16z crypto. On-chain TVL
appears modest (~$500K on DeFiLlama [3]), though aggregate stream volume across
27 chains is substantially larger; short-lived streams and multi-chain
fragmentation understate the snapshot metric.

**Streamflow** is the most complete Solana-native vesting platform, covering
vesting, airdrops, staking, token locks, and on-chain payroll [4]. It charges
flat SOL fees per contract (0.16 SOL, approximately $20 at current prices) and
offers an auto-claim keeper that pushes tokens to recipients at each unlock
event for an additional 0.25 SOL. Cancellation permissions are configurable
(sender, recipient, or either party). Streamflow does not use NFT-based
positions; vesting positions are non-transferable.

**Hedgey Finance** is free at all levels and provides the cleanest conceptual
model in the ecosystem: Vesting Plans (revocable, for employees and
contributors) and Lockup Plans (non-revocable, transferable, for investors) [5].
Both types are represented as ERC-721 NFTs, with bound (soulbound) variants
available. Hedgey uniquely supports governance voting with locked tokens. In
April 2024, $44.5M was drained from a deprecated ClaimCampaigns.sol contract via
a flash loan exploit [14]; core Vesting and Lockup Plan contracts were not
directly affected.

**Jupiter Lock** launched in August 2024 as a free, open-source, audited vesting
tool built by Jupiter Exchange, the leading Solana DEX aggregator [6]. Its
distribution advantage is inherent: teams already using Jupiter for trading
naturally discover Jupiter Lock. All locks are publicly viewable on the UI,
positioning transparency as a credibility signal. Audited by Sec3 and OtterSec.

**Team Finance** bundles vesting contracts with LP token locks and a branded
embeddable widget that projects can place on their own website [7]. The branded
vesting widget is unique in the ecosystem. Fixed USD-equivalent fees (~$150 per
chain in native token) apply to each action, with Pro and Enterprise
subscription tiers available.

**Superfluid** implements gas-free continuous streaming via the Super Token
standard (an ERC-20 extension) [8]. Balances update mathematically at query time
without per-tick gas costs. A VestingScheduler module adds cliff and end-date
support on top of the core streaming primitives. Superfluid does not escrow
tokens (sender can cancel at any time), making it a weaker commitment device
than escrow-based protocols.

**LlamaPay** is a gas-efficient EVM streaming protocol (3.2 to 3.7x cheaper than
Sablier) using a shared contract model rather than per-stream deployments [9].
It is focused on payroll, not structured vesting: it supports no cliff, no
milestone, and no discrete unlock schedules.

**Bonfida** produced the first audited Solana vesting contract (2020) [10]. It
is a reference implementation, not a hosted product: a minimal on-chain program
with a permissionless unlock crank (any wallet can trigger token release at the
specified slot height). Bonfida influenced the broader Solana vesting ecosystem
but is largely superseded by Streamflow and Jupiter Lock.

**AbdelStark ERC-20** is an Apache-2.0 Solidity library providing cliff + linear
vesting with a configurable slice period parameter that unifies continuous and
discrete unlock models [11]. Audited by Hacken. Published as the
`erc20-token-vesting` npm package. It is a developer library, not a hosted
protocol.

**Tokenomist** (formerly TokenUnlocks) is the canonical token unlock data
aggregator [12]. It tracks on-chain-verified vesting schedules across major
crypto projects and published the $97.43B aggregate unlock figure for 2025.
Tokenomist does not provide vesting infrastructure; it provides the data layer
that institutional investors use to anticipate unlock events.

## Schedule Types

Protocols implement between one and six schedule types. RFP-017 requires three:
cliff + linear, fully linear, and milestone-based.

| Protocol          | Cliff + Linear  | Fully Linear | Milestone             | Periodic Tranched            | Custom Curves       | Per-second Streaming |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Magna             | Yes             | Yes          | Yes                   | Yes                          | No                  | No                   |
| Sablier           | Yes             | Yes          | No                    | Yes (LockupTranched)         | Yes (LockupDynamic) | Yes                  |
| Streamflow        | Yes             | Yes          | No                    | Yes                          | No                  | No                   |
| Hedgey Finance    | Yes             | Yes          | Yes (admin-triggered) | Yes                          | No                  | No                   |
| Jupiter Lock      | Yes             | Yes          | No                    | Yes                          | No                  | No                   |
| Team Finance      | Yes             | Yes          | No                    | Yes                          | No                  | No                   |
| Superfluid        | Yes (scheduler) | Yes          | No                    | No                           | No                  | Yes                  |
| LlamaPay          | No              | Yes          | No                    | No                           | No                  | Yes                  |
| Bonfida           | Yes             | Yes          | No                    | Yes (slot-based)             | No                  | No                   |
| AbdelStark ERC-20 | Yes             | Yes          | No                    | Yes (via slicePeriodSeconds) | No                  | No                   |

**Cliff + linear** is the de facto industry standard for team and investor
allocations. Every major protocol supports it. The typical configuration is a
1-year cliff followed by 3 years of linear release (4 years total).

**Fully linear** (cliff = 0) is supported by every protocol that supports cliff
\+ linear. It is appropriate for ongoing contributors, advisors, and grant
programmes where disbursement should begin immediately.

**Milestone-based** is the rarest schedule type. Only Hedgey and Magna support
admin-triggered milestones. No protocol in the studied set implements trustless
off-chain milestone verification; all milestone implementations require a
trusted admin or governance body to signal completion. RFP-017's decision to
keep milestone authority with the creator (not an on-chain oracle) aligns with
existing practice.

**Custom curves** are exclusive to Sablier (LockupDynamic), which allows
arbitrary vesting shapes defined as segment arrays with different rates. This
enables exponential, front-loaded, step function, and other non-linear
schedules. No other protocol offers this capability.

**Per-second streaming** is offered by Sablier, LlamaPay, and Superfluid. It
distributes tokens continuously rather than in discrete events, eliminating
concentrated unlock-day sell pressure. RFP-017 does not require streaming; the
three required schedule types cover the full range of real-world vesting
relationships.

## Fee Structures

Fee competition in the vesting market has been largely won by the zero-fee camp:
7 of 10 protocols studied have zero protocol fees.

| Protocol          | Protocol Fee                     | Per-Schedule Cost    | Claim Fee                 | Notes                                                                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Magna             | Undisclosed [1]                  | Undisclosed          | Undisclosed               | Enterprise pricing; negotiated per client                                     |
| Sablier           | Zero [2]                         | Gas only             | Gas only                  | Optional broker fee (0--10%) for third-party integrators; official UI is free |
| Streamflow        | 0.16 SOL (~$20) per contract [4] | 0.16 SOL             | 0.009--0.017 SOL          | Auto-claim add-on: 0.25 SOL; airdrop clawback: 1.70% of tokens returned       |
| Hedgey Finance    | Zero [5]                         | Gas only             | Gas only                  | 100% free at all levels                                                       |
| Jupiter Lock      | Zero [6]                         | Solana gas only      | Solana gas only           | Confirmed by Jupiter's official announcement                                  |
| Team Finance      | ~$150 per chain [7]              | Flat per action      | Gas only                  | Pro and Enterprise subscription tiers available                               |
| Superfluid        | Gas (stream start/stop) [8]      | Gas only             | Zero (continuous netting) | SUP governance token launched Feb 2025                                        |
| LlamaPay          | Zero [9]                         | Gas only             | Gas only                  | Shared contract model minimises per-stream gas                                |
| Bonfida           | Zero [10]                        | Solana tx (~$0.0005) | Solana tx (~$0.0005)      | Unlock crank fee paid by whoever calls it                                     |
| AbdelStark ERC-20 | Zero [11]                        | Gas (EVM)            | Gas (EVM)                 | Self-deployed library                                                         |

**Streamflow's 1.70% airdrop clawback fee** is the only percentage-based fee in
the ecosystem. It applies specifically to airdrop cancellations (tokens returned
via clawback), not to standard vesting operations. Standard Streamflow vesting
cancellations incur no percentage fee.

**Team Finance's flat USD fee** (~$150 per chain in native token) is predictable
regardless of token value. It is efficiently priced for multi-recipient
distributions: the per-recipient cost falls to near-zero for large batches. Pro
and Enterprise subscription tiers are available for high-volume projects.

**Sablier's broker fee model** is unique: third-party front-end integrators can
charge up to 10% of the streamed token amount when users create streams through
their interface [2]. The official Sablier UI charges zero broker fee. This
creates an incentive for third-party developers to build on Sablier without the
core protocol needing to charge fees.

### Design implications

Zero fees are the dominant model and the most adoption-friendly design. Any
RFP-017 implementation on LEZ should default to zero protocol fees, with a
governance-activatable fee switch for future monetisation. Sablier V2 included
such a switch (admin-controlled, hard-capped at 10%) but never activated it and
removed it in V2.2; current Sablier versions charge modest interface fees
instead [2]. A broker fee for third-party integrators and launchpad partners is
worth considering. LEZ transaction and proof costs will be the primary
user-facing expense.

### Cost comparison for 100-recipient vesting

For a standardised scenario (100 recipients, 1,000 tokens each, 4-year schedule
with 1-year cliff):

| Protocol                   | Approach           | Approximate Total Cost (100 recipients)           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Sablier (Arbitrum/Base)    | Bulk multi-call    | ~$10 creation gas + recipient claim gas           |
| Sablier (Merkle airdrop)   | Merkle root + pull | ~$10 one-time setup; recipients pay own claim gas |
| Sablier (Ethereum mainnet) | Bulk multi-call    | $500--$2,000 creation gas                         |
| Streamflow (Solana)        | CSV bulk           | 16 SOL (~$2,000)                                  |
| Hedgey (Arbitrum)          | Multi-call         | ~$10 creation gas + recipient claim gas           |
| Jupiter Lock (Solana)      | Individual         | Negligible (Solana gas only)                      |
| Team Finance (Ethereum)    | Flat fee           | ~$150 flat + EVM gas                              |
| Bonfida (Solana)           | Individual         | Negligible (Solana gas only)                      |

The Merkle airdrop model (Sablier) is the most gas-efficient approach for 1,000+
recipients: one on-chain Merkle root commitment covers all recipients, with each
recipient paying their own claim gas. Creator cost does not scale with recipient
count.

## Cancellation and Revocation

Every protocol that supports cancellation follows a universal invariant:
**vested tokens belong to the recipient and cannot be reclaimed; unvested tokens
return to the creator.**

| Protocol          | Cancellation Model                                                 | Vested Handling           | Unvested Handling | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Magna             | Standard split (on-chain); creator-controlled (off-chain) [1]      | Recipient keeps           | Creator reclaims  | Off-chain mode gives creator full distribution control                |
| Sablier           | Cancelable or non-cancelable (set at creation) [15]                | Recipient keeps           | Creator reclaims  | One-way conversion: cancelable to non-cancelable (irreversible)       |
| Streamflow        | Configurable: sender, recipient, or either [4]                     | Recipient keeps           | Creator reclaims  | No pause/resume                                                       |
| Hedgey Finance    | Vesting Plans: revocable by admin; Lockup Plans: non-revocable [5] | Recipient keeps           | Admin reclaims    | Two-product separation cleanly distinguishes revocable vs irrevocable |
| Jupiter Lock      | Configurable: creator, recipient, both, or neither [6]             | Recipient keeps           | Creator reclaims  | "Neither" creates an irrevocable commitment                           |
| Team Finance      | Revocable schedules: creator cancels [7]                           | Recipient keeps           | Creator reclaims  |                                                                       |
| Superfluid        | Sender cancels any time [8]                                        | Recipient keeps (accrued) | Stops streaming   | No escrow: sender can simply stop the stream                          |
| LlamaPay          | Payer cancels any time [9]                                         | Recipient keeps (accrued) | Stops streaming   | No escrow                                                             |
| Bonfida           | Not documented [10]                                                | N/A                       | N/A               | Likely no cancellation in base design                                 |
| AbdelStark ERC-20 | Revocable flag set at creation [11]                                | Recipient keeps           | Owner reclaims    | Non-revocable schedules cannot be cancelled                           |

All protocols guarantee that vested-but-unclaimed tokens remain claimable by the
recipient after cancellation, with no documented time expiry.

**Sablier's unique features.** Sablier Lockup offers a one-way conversion from
cancelable to non-cancelable \[15\]: once a stream is made non-cancelable, this
change is irreversible. This serves as a credible commitment mechanism (projects
can issue vesting to investors and later make it irrevocable as a trust signal).
Sablier Flow (open-ended streaming) uniquely supports pause and resume rather
than outright cancellation [15]; pausing preserves accrued debt through cycles.
No other protocol offers pause/resume.

**Hedgey's two-product separation** is the cleanest conceptual model for the
revocable/irrevocable distinction [5]. Vesting Plans (for employees,
contributors) are revocable by the Vesting Admin. Lockup Plans (for investors)
are non-revocable by design and transferable via NFT, giving investors an
irrevocable right to locked tokens with secondary market exit.

**Configurable cancel permissions** (Streamflow, Jupiter Lock) allow the same
contract interface to serve both revocable team vesting and irrevocable investor
lockups by setting the cancellation authority at creation time [4][6].

RFP-017 follows the universal invariant: on cancellation, vested tokens remain
claimable by the beneficiary and unvested tokens return to the creator.

## Transferable Positions

Position transferability determines whether the right to receive future vested
tokens can itself be transferred or sold.

**Sablier's NFT model** is the most composable approach. Every stream is an
ERC-721 NFT held by the recipient [2]. The NFT can be sold on any marketplace,
used as collateral in lending protocols that accept ERC-721, or transferred
instantly without creator involvement. A recipient with a 4-year linear schedule
who is 1 year in can sell the NFT at a discount to the present value of the
remaining stream, giving the buyer the right to receive the remaining vested
tokens.

**Hedgey's NFT model** adds a critical investor protection layer [5]. Lockup
Plan NFTs are both non-revocable and transferable: the buyer of a Lockup Plan
NFT has a guaranteed, irrevocable right to the locked tokens. Vesting Plan NFTs
are transferable but revocable (the Vesting Admin can still revoke), so buyers
accept revocation risk. Hedgey also offers "bound" (soulbound) variants for
identity-linked vesting where secondary market trading is undesirable.

**Jupiter Lock and Streamflow** offer a simpler model: the recipient address can
be changed if the creator granted that permission at creation [4][6]. This is
less flexible than NFT-based ownership because it typically requires explicit
permission and does not enable frictionless secondary market trading.

RFP-017 specifies configurable transferability at creation (frozen afterwards).
The NFT-based model (Sablier, Hedgey) represents current best practice for
composability and secondary market access, though the implementation choice is
left to the proposer.

## Privacy

**No existing token vesting protocol provides any privacy features whatsoever.**
This is not a partial gap; it is an absolute absence across every protocol
studied.

All protocols publish all vesting parameters on-chain: token, total amount,
schedule type, cliff date, end date, and beneficiary address. Every claim event
(amount, recipient, timestamp) is publicly visible. Cancellations, milestone
signals, and position transfers are all observable.

**Jupiter Lock explicitly celebrates transparency as a product feature** [6].
All locks are displayed on a public explorer, positioning on-chain visibility as
a credibility signal for project teams and investors.

The entire sector frames on-chain vesting transparency as a benefit (investors
can verify schedules), not a limitation. No protocol has ZK-based vesting on its
roadmap as of April 2026.

### The problem with full transparency

This universal transparency creates real problems:

- **Front-running unlock events.** Unlock schedules are public; traders position
  ahead of large unlocks anticipating sell pressure. The April 2025 MANTRA ($OM)
  collapse (90% in hours, from over $6 to under $0.50, wiping over $5B in market
  cap [18]), while not solely caused by front-running, illustrates the fragility
  of transparent unlock mechanics at scale.
- **Investor allocation leakage.** A project's fundraising round terms are
  effectively public once vesting contracts are deployed. Competitors, token
  analytics firms, and short sellers all have access.
- **Recipient targeting.** Large token grants to known addresses are publicly
  trackable. Recipients of significant allocations become targets for phishing
  and social engineering.

### What RFP-017's claim-and-re-shield would change

RFP-017 introduces privacy at the post-claim layer:

1. Schedule parameters remain public (identical to all existing protocols).
2. Claim events are public (amount, beneficiary, timestamp).
3. Claimed tokens are deposited into LEZ's shielded pool via the
   claim-and-re-shield pattern.
4. Subsequent movements of claimed tokens are private.

This means recipients can accumulate and manage vested tokens without on-chain
surveillance. Investors cannot be front-run when their large unlock events
trigger. Contributor grants are not publicly visible to competitors after
claiming. Post-vesting token movements (swap, stake, transfer) are private.

RFP-017 would be the first privacy-preserving token vesting protocol in
production, even in this limited claim-and-re-shield form.
