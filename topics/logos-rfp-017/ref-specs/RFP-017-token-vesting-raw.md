## 🧭 Overview

Build a token vesting program on LEZ that locks project, team, or investor
tokens against configurable time-based schedules (cliff, linear, or
milestone-based). Recipients can claim vested tokens directly to a public
account or to a private account. When claimed to a private account, the
destination and all subsequent token movements are hidden from on-chain
observers.

Token vesting is a prerequisite for credible token launches. Every protocol that
issues a token must lock some allocation for founders, early contributors, or
ecosystem reserves. The scale of this market is substantial: Tokenomist
documented $97.43B in token vesting unlocks during 2025 alone, and Magna (the
largest vesting platform) reached $60B peak TVL before being acquired by Kraken.
Despite this scale, leading protocols (Sablier, Hedgey, Jupiter Lock) charge
zero fees, and no existing protocol offers any privacy features for vesting (see
[Appendix: Token Vesting Ecosystem](../appendix/token-vesting-ecosystem.md)).

## 🔥 Why This Matters

On transparent chains, vesting contracts (Streamflow, Sablier, Team.Finance) are
surveillance tools: every cliff unlock, every linear release, and every claim is
publicly linkable to a beneficiary address, exposing token unlock schedules to
the market and enabling adversarial trading against known unlock events. With
$97.43B in token unlocks during 2025 tracked by public analytics platforms like
Tokenomist, traders routinely index upcoming unlock events and position against
them before the beneficiary can act. The April 2025 MANTRA ($OM) collapse (90%
in hours, from over $6 to under $0.50, wiping over $5B in market cap), while not
solely caused by front-running, illustrates the fragility of transparent unlock
mechanics at scale.

On LEZ, recipients can claim vested tokens directly to a private account.
Observers see that a claim occurred; they cannot determine which private account
holds the tokens or trace subsequent movements. This makes LEZ the only
environment where teams can vest tokens without creating a public unlock
calendar for adversarial front-running.

Vesting is also a composition primitive. A launchpad (see
[RFP-016](./RFP-016-lbp-launchpad.md)) or investor round on LEZ needs vesting to
be in place before tokens can be distributed to contributors and early backers.
This RFP is a direct prerequisite for a credible token economy on LEZ.

## 🏗 Design Rationale

### Three schedule types: cliff+linear, fully linear, milestone

These three types cover the full range of real-world vesting relationships
without unnecessary complexity.

**Cliff + linear** is the industry standard for team and investor allocations.
The cliff (commonly 1 year) prevents immediate selling at TGE and signals that
insiders have a long-term commitment. Linear release after the cliff aligns
incentives continuously over the remaining period; recipients have ongoing
reason to contribute. This pattern is used in virtually every serious protocol's
team allocation.

**Fully linear** (no cliff) is appropriate for ongoing contributors (advisors,
contractors) where there is no fixed start date requiring a binary lock-up, or
for grant programmes where disbursement should begin immediately.

**Milestone-based** serves deliverable-oriented relationships: grants,
partnerships, or service agreements where time-based vesting is economically
incorrect. Unlocking tokens when a milestone is achieved rather than when a date
passes better reflects the nature of the obligation. Importantly, milestone
authority stays with the creator, not an on-chain oracle; this is intentional:
the conditions for milestone completion are often qualitative and cannot be
reliably evaluated on-chain.

### Cancellation semantics

Whether a schedule is cancelable is set at creation and defaults to cancelable.
A cancelable schedule can be converted to non-cancelable (irreversible); the
reverse is not permitted. This one-way conversion serves as a credible
commitment mechanism: a project can issue vesting to investors and later make it
irrevocable as a trust signal, following the pattern established by Sablier and
Hedgey (see
[Appendix: Cancellation and Revocation](../appendix/token-vesting-ecosystem.md#cancellation-and-revocation)).

When a cancelable schedule is cancelled, unvested tokens return to the creator;
already-vested but unclaimed tokens remain claimable by the beneficiary. This
reflects the economic reality of the relationship: vested tokens are earned
compensation that cannot be revoked. Unvested tokens represent future commitment
not yet earned, and returning them to the creator on early termination is the
universal invariant across every protocol in the ecosystem (Streamflow, Sablier,
Team.Finance, and others alike). Burning unvested tokens would destroy value
unnecessarily and make the program harder to adopt.

### Transferable positions as a creation-time flag

Whether a vesting position is transferable to a new beneficiary address is set
at creation and cannot be changed afterwards. For employment vesting, the
incentive is personal; the position should be non-transferable so the token lock
applies specifically to the individual. For investor positions, secondary
transfers may be needed (assignment of rights, secondary market sales of locked
tokens). Allowing this to be configured at creation but frozen afterwards avoids
mid-schedule ambiguity: all parties know the rules when the schedule is created
and cannot change them unilaterally later.

### Batch creation

Token launches routinely create vesting schedules for many recipients
simultaneously (co-founders, advisors, early contributors, investor tranches).
Creating them one by one is gas-expensive and error-prone. Batch creation is a
practical necessity, not a nice-to-have, for any real-world launch. The batch
size is bounded by the LEZ transaction size limit, which the implementation must
document.

### Fee structure

This RFP does not mandate a specific fee rate. The ecosystem trend is decisively
toward zero protocol fees: 7 of 10 vesting protocols surveyed charge nothing
beyond gas (see
[Appendix: Fee Structures](../appendix/token-vesting-ecosystem.md#fee-structures)).
Proposals must specify:

1. **Who pays:** whether fees (if any) are charged to the schedule creator, the
   beneficiary at claim time, or both.
2. **When fees are collected:** at schedule creation, at each claim event, at
   cancellation, or a combination.
3. **Fee rate:** the exact rate or range, including whether a
   governance-activatable fee switch is included for future adjustment.
4. **Where fees are routed:** the destination account or mechanism (protocol
   treasury, burn, staking reward pool, etc.).

A governance-activatable fee switch with an initial zero rate is the recommended
baseline. An optional broker fee for third-party integrators (launchpads,
distribution platforms) may be included but is not required.

## ✅ Scope of Work

### Hard Requirements

#### Functionality

1. Implement a vesting program on LEZ that locks tokens in escrow against a
   configured schedule. The program must support:
   - **Cliff + linear vesting**: tokens become claimable in a lump sum at the
     cliff date, then linearly over the remaining duration (e.g., 1-year cliff,
     3-year linear release).
   - **Fully linear vesting**: no cliff; tokens accrue continuously from the
     start date.
   - **Milestone-based vesting**: the schedule creator explicitly signals
     completion of discrete tranches; each signal unlocks a fixed token amount
     for the beneficiary to claim.
2. The schedule creator specifies the beneficiary at schedule creation.
   Recipients can claim vested tokens to a public account or to a private
   account. The schedule creator does not learn the recipient's private account
   address from the claim interaction.
3. The schedule creator sets whether the schedule is cancelable at creation time
   (default: cancelable). A cancelable schedule can be converted to
   non-cancelable by the creator; this conversion is irreversible. When a
   cancelable schedule is cancelled, the unclaimed, unvested token balance
   returns to the creator's account. Tokens already vested but not yet claimed
   remain claimable by the beneficiary after cancellation.
4. The schedule creator can configure whether the vesting position (beneficiary
   rights) is transferable to a new beneficiary. Transferability must be set at
   schedule creation and cannot be changed afterwards.
5. Multi-recipient batch creation: a creator can set up vesting schedules for
   multiple recipients in a single operation, up to the LEZ transaction size
   limit. Document the maximum number of recipients achievable in one
   transaction.
6. The program emits a log event (using the LEZ event/log mechanism; see
   [LP-0012](https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/blob/master/prizes/LP-0012.md))
   for each state transition: schedule creation, claim, cancellation, milestone
   signal, and beneficiary transfer. Event schema must be documented.

#### Usability

1. Provide an SDK that can be used to build Logos modules interacting with the
   vesting program. The SDK must expose the full lifecycle: create schedule,
   query claimable amount, claim, cancel, signal milestone, and transfer
   beneficiary. The SDK must support claiming to both public and private
   accounts.
2. Provide a Logos mini-app GUI with local build instructions, downloadable
   assets, and loadable in Logos app (Basecamp) via git repo. The mini-app must
   cover at minimum:
   - **Recipient view**: current vesting position, total locked, amount
     claimable now, next unlock event, claim action.
   - **Creator view**: create a new schedule (all parameters), list active
     schedules, cancel a schedule, signal a milestone.
3. Provide a CLI that covers core functionality of the program. The CLI may have
   fewer features than the GUI mini-app but must support all essential
   operations: create schedule, claim, cancel, signal milestone, and query
   claimable amount.
4. The mini-app must display a pre-claim confirmation summary: claimable amount
   and estimated transaction fee. When using the private account path, it must
   confirm that the beneficiary account has sufficient gas to cover the claim; a
   clear, actionable error must be shown if the balance is insufficient.
5. When using the private account path, the mini-app must display a privacy
   disclosure before each claim, identifying what will be visible on-chain
   (claim amount, beneficiary address, vesting schedule address) and what will
   not be traceable (the destination private account and subsequent movements).
6. Provide an IDL for the vesting program using the
   [SPEL framework](https://github.com/logos-co/spel).
7. Failed claims must return clear, actionable error messages, including the
   case where nothing is yet claimable (with the next unlock time displayed).

#### Reliability

1. A claim is atomic: a failed or rejected claim does not consume vested tokens
   and leaves the claimant able to retry without loss.
2. A schedule cancellation is atomic: partial failure leaves the schedule in its
   prior state, not an undefined one.
3. Concurrent claims against independent schedules must not corrupt shared
   program state.
4. Milestone signalling is idempotent per milestone index: signalling the same
   milestone twice must be rejected with a deterministic error and must not
   double-unlock tokens.

#### Performance

1. A single claim completes within one LEZ transaction.
2. Document the compute unit (CU) cost of each operation: create schedule,
   claim, cancel, signal milestone, transfer beneficiary. Note the LEZ testnet
   version against which measurements were taken, as the per-transaction compute
   budget may change.

#### Supportability

Proposals must include separate milestones for testnet 0.2, testnet 0.3, and
mainnet deployment.

1. The vesting program is deployed and tested on LEZ testnet 0.2.
2. End-to-end integration tests run against a LEZ sequencer (standalone mode)
   and are included in CI. CI must be green on the default branch.
3. Every hard requirement in Functionality, Usability, Reliability, and
   Performance has at least one corresponding test.
4. A README documents end-to-end usage: deployment steps, program addresses, and
   step-by-step instructions for creating a schedule, claiming, and cancelling
   via CLI and mini-app.
5. The program is updated and verified on LEZ testnet 0.3.
6. The program is deployed to LEZ mainnet.

#### + Privacy

1. The mini-app and SDK must support claiming to both public and private
   accounts.
2. When using the private account path, the mini-app must display the
   pre-confirmation privacy disclosure described in the Usability section before
   each claim, identifying what is visible on-chain (claim amount, beneficiary
   address, vesting schedule address) and what remains private (the destination
   private account and subsequent movements of claimed tokens).
3. When using the private account path, the SDK must validate that the claim
   target is a private (shielded) account before submitting the transaction, and
   reject with an explicit error if it is not.

### Privacy Architecture

Vesting schedule parameters (token, total amount, schedule type, cliff date, end
date, beneficiary address) are public on-chain state. This is a deliberate
architectural choice: public state enables permissionless observability of
schedule terms and composability with other programs.

Privacy is enforced at the claim layer. LEZ programs can credit tokens directly
to a private account without routing through a public intermediary: any program
may increase any account's balance, including foreign private accounts. This
means the vesting program can release tokens straight into the beneficiary's
private account at claim time.

#### Claim to public or private account

Recipients choose at claim time whether tokens go to a public account or a
private account.

When claiming to a **public account**, the claim is fully transparent: observers
see the recipient address, the amount, and can trace subsequent token movements.
This is identical to every existing vesting protocol.

When claiming to a **private account**, the vesting program credits the
beneficiary's private account directly. Observers see that a claim occurred
(amount and timestamp) but cannot determine which private account holds the
tokens or trace subsequent movements.

#### What is public (observable on-chain)

- All vesting schedule parameters: token, total amount, schedule type, cliff
  date, end date, beneficiary address.
- All claim events: amount claimed and timestamp.
- Cancellations and milestone signals.

#### What is private (when claiming to a private account)

- Which private account holds the claimed tokens.
- Subsequent movements of claimed tokens.

#### Privacy limitation

The beneficiary address is permanently and publicly associated with the vesting
schedule from the moment it is created. Every claim from the schedule is
observably linked to that address. The privacy guarantee covers post-claim token
movements only: the destination private account and all subsequent activity are
untraceable, but the beneficiary's association with the vesting position cannot
be hidden. For full beneficiary anonymity, commitment-based beneficiary
registration (depending on LP-0003) would be required; this is deferred to a
future RFP.

### Soft Requirements

- The creator can nominate a separate cancellation authority distinct from the
  creator wallet (useful when vesting is managed by a multisig or DAO).
- The creator can nominate a separate milestone authority distinct from the
  creator wallet. Creator-controlled milestone authority is appropriate for team
  vesting, but creates a conflict of interest when vesting is used for buyer
  protection (e.g., creator collateral vesting from a token launch per
  [RFP-015](./RFP-015-bonding-curve-launchpad.md) or
  [RFP-016](./RFP-016-lbp-launchpad.md)): the creator could approve milestones
  and drain funds immediately. Delegating milestone authority to a governance
  body or multisig that excludes the creator prevents this.

## ⚠ Platform Dependencies

LEZ has similar programming capabilities to Solana but one primitive required by
a vesting protocol is not yet available. Development is blocked until the
dependencies below are resolved.

### Hard dependencies

#### Token authorities (LP-0013)

The vesting program is a token custodian: it escrows the full schedule amount at
creation and pays vested tokens to beneficiaries on claim. This requires the
transfer-authority primitives in
[LP-0013](https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/blob/master/prizes/LP-0013.md),
currently **open**.

### Resolved dependencies

These primitives were once blockers but are now delivered on LEZ, so they no
longer gate this RFP. They remain in the frontmatter `dependencies` index for
traceability.

#### On-chain clock / timestamp

Vesting schedules are fundamentally time-based: the cliff date, linear accrual
rate, and total vested amount at any moment are all functions of elapsed time.
The LEZ clock program now maintains on-chain timestamp accounts that any program
can read, so this is **delivered**.

#### General cross-program calls (LP-0015)

A claim operation must: (1) verify the schedule and compute the claimable
amount, (2) call the token program to transfer the vested tokens to the
beneficiary, and then (3) update the schedule state (recording the claimed
amount and timestamp). General cross-program calls via tail calls let step 3 run
in a protected continuation after step 2.
[LP-0015](https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/blob/master/prizes/LP-0015.md)
is **closed**, delivered by the LEZ team as part of the core runtime.

#### Event emission (LP-0012)

Off-chain dashboards and notification services react to vesting events (schedule
created, cliff reached, tokens claimed, schedule cancelled) through structured
events rather than polling every account.
[LP-0012](https://github.com/logos-co/lambda-prize/blob/master/prizes/LP-0012.md)
is **closed**.

### Soft dependencies

Desirable but not required to begin development.

#### Admin authority (RFP-001)

If a proposal includes a protocol fee with a governance-activatable fee switch
(see Fee structure), the fee configuration should reuse the standardised admin
authority library from [RFP-001](./RFP-001-admin-authority-lib.md). Since the
fee switch is optional, this is a soft dependency rather than a frontmatter
entry.
